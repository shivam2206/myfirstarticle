# My First Article 
## A simple blogging application developed using Flask

It's just a result of the motivation to sharpen my as well as others skills in Python. The intention behind making this an open-source project is just to hear about the possible improvements from the brilliant minds of the rest of the world.
I am trying my best to make this project production-ready not only from the deployment perspective but more from a robust & scalable code perspective. During my learning days, I really couldn't find any single place helping in understanding different Flask features/extensions altogether. Flask is not alone, it comes with its vast ecosystem.

I will keep adding stuff to make this one place for most of the developers who are in the early stages of learning Python &amp; Flask-based production-ready applications.

I'll appreciate any feedback. I am very active on the following platforms - 
- <a href="https://github.com/shivam2206">Github</a>
- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivam2206/">Linkedin</a>

I'll add steps soon to run this project on local.
