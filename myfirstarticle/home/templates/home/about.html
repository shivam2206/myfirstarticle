                So you are here probably looking at what this project does. Well, nothing new but it's a result of the motivation to sharpen my as well as others skills in Python. The intention behind making this an open-source project is just to hear about the possible improvements from the brilliant minds of the rest of the world.
                <br><br>
                I am trying my best to make this project production-ready not only from the deployment perspective but more from a robust & scalable code perspective. During my learning days, I really couldn't find any single place helping in understanding different Flask features/extensions altogether. Flask is not alone, it comes with its vast ecosystem.

                <br><br>
                I will keep adding stuff to make this one place for most of the developers who are in the early stages of learning Python &amp; Flask-based production-ready applications.

                <br> I'll appreciate any feedback. You can reach out to me on <a href="https://github.com/shivam2206">Github</a>
